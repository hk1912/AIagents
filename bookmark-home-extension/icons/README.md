# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the extension:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, or online tools like Canva. The icons should be square and saved in PNG format with the exact dimensions specified above.

## Icon Design Guidelines

For the best appearance in Microsoft Edge:

1. Use a simple, recognizable design that works well at small sizes
2. Ensure good contrast for visibility
3. Use the Microsoft Edge blue color (#0078d7) to match the extension's theme
4. Include a transparent background if appropriate
5. Test how your icon looks in both light and dark browser themes

## Placeholder Icons

Until you create custom icons, you can use the following steps to generate placeholder icons:

1. Open the `icon-generator.html` file in your browser.
2. Click the "Download" buttons to save each icon to your computer.
3. Place the downloaded icons in this `icons` directory, naming them `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, and `icon128.png`.

## Example Icon Design

A simple design could be:
- A blue square with rounded corners
- A white bookmark or folder symbol in the center
- Clean edges that look good at small sizes
